      <p>
        The Computer Science and Engineering Society is a student-run society
        that aims to provide a platform for students to learn and grow. The
        society was founded in 2015 by a group of students who wanted to create
        a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about
        technology. Since then, the society has grown to become one of the most
        active societies on campus, with over 500 members and a wide range of
        activities and events.
      </p>
      <p>
        The society organizes a variety of events throughout the year, including
        workshops, hackathons, and guest lectures. These events are designed to
        help students develop their technical skills, learn about the latest
        trends in technology, and network with industry professionals. The
        society also runs several projects, including a coding competition, a
        tech blog, and a mentorship program.
      </p>
      <p>
        The society is open to all students who are interested in technology,
        regardless of their background or experience. Whether you are a complete
        beginner or an experienced coder, there is something for everyone in the
        Computer Science and Engineering Society. We are always looking for new
        members to join us and help us grow, so if you are passionate about
        technology and want to be part of a vibrant community, we would love to
        hear from you!
      </p>
